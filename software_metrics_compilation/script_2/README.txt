The commented part of the script, is what I used in the real experiment. 
To do the same, uncomment it and coment what is not commented at the bottom of the script, which is used for demonstration purposes.

Please run the following command on linux subsystem:

$> python3 gzoltar_coverage.py

You must get the same output in this folder as the one in folder "expected".
