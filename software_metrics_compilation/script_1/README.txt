The commented part of the script, is what I used in the real experiment. 
To do the same, uncomment it and coment what is not commented at the bottom of the script, which is used for demonstration purposes.

Please run the following command on linux subsystem:

$> python3 checkout_buggy_v.py

You must get the same output in this folder as the one in folder "expected".

Please organize all the extracted buggy versions in folders by project. We have 6 projects "Time, Chart, Math..."
It will take you 30 seconds at max. This operation is mandatory for next steps.
