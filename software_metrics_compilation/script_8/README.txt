In this phase, we are creating the bug characteristics metrics for each class in each buggy version project

Run the following command: "python assign_Labels.py"

	to assign class labels to each java class and create the the bug characteristic metrics for each java class in the projects

The output of this step should be similar to the one in folder "expected" for the two buggy versions

To run it for all the projects, please comment the test and uncomment the commented code.
You will have to modify the parameters of the function tailored to your desired folder structure.
