For this Java project to run properely, you will have to run the previous scripts since it will make use
of the output in "script_7\expected" and the source code of the buggy versions.

For demonstration purposes, you can open the java project in any IDE and run the main class "CMSRunner.java"

For demonstration purposes, I have already made the setup for this run making use of the output of the previous script.

The result should be similar to the one in "expected"
